# Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe repository page!
Hi! This is a sample tic tac toe game writen in python(3.7.x).

## Thought process
1. Print empty board on screen.
2. Players will be playing PVP.
3. Develop computer player(advanced tought process)(IN PROGRESS).
4. Start playing the game and ask for players inputs and put them in the specific spot in the board.
5. Update board everytime players play.
6. Check if someone wins te games or if it is tie game.
7. In case it is a tie game, check if the board if full and there is no more space for players to play.
8. Print out the winner or tied game.

## Future Improvements
1. Create a computer player(AI).
2. Let first user decide if he wants to be X or O.
3. Random the first user that is going to play.
